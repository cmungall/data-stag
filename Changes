Changelog for Data::Stag

Version 0.01

============

2002-12-20	- Added Data::Stag::Writer and tidied up writer classes

Version 0.03
============

2003-04-29	- Fixed bug with empty XML tags being treated as nulls
                - Fixed bug with XML parsing/export where zero-valued
                  pcdata was treated as empty string
                  (new test emptytag.t added for these)
                - Modified behaviour of BaseHandler - now the whole
                  stag object is passed. This can be manipulated by
                  the intercepting code directly
                - Added makehandler() to Data::Stag

                - BIG CHANGE: behaviour of 'get' now different;
                  if the value 'got' is a terminal, will return
                  the node data; if it is non-terminal, it will
                  return the node itself (like getnode()).
                  there is a new method 'getdata' for explicitly
                  getting the data value in all cases

                - added ChainHandler
		- added various stag-* scripts
