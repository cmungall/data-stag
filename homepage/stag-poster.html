    <p>
      DBStag generates <i>Stag</i> objects from query results. These can
      be represented as XML or in-memory as perl objects. The
      ingredients are (1) a database schema, (2) an SQL query on a
      database conforming to that schema and (3) the results of that SQL
      query. No extra information (meta-data, mapping files) is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stag objects can be manipulated by XSLT transforms, or by perl
      applications using the Stag library - for instance, to produce
      documents for the web.
